# D2: Phase Sequencing

First-class multi-phase execution: scope spawn --phases red,green,refactor 'implement auth'. Each phase runs sequentially as a DAG chain with output of one piping into the next automatically. Scope expands this into a multi-node DAG. Each phase gets a contract with phase-specific instructions and prior phase results.

## Acceptance Criteria

- scope spawn --phases phase1,phase2,phase3 'task' expands into a sequential DAG with piping
- Each phase gets a contract that includes phase-specific instructions and the prior phase's result
- Orchestrator can customize per-phase contracts or accept defaults
- Phase names are meaningful and appear in session IDs / TUI
- Builds on D1 (result piping) for inter-phase data flow
