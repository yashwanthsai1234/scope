# D5: Programmatic Workflows

Python builder pattern for defining reusable DAGs programmatically. Not YAML — real code that can express conditionals, loops, and parameterization. 'scope run workflows/tdd.py --target src/auth'. A Workflow/Phase API that composes piping, conditions, and retries into executable DAG definitions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Python API: from scope import Workflow, Phase — builder pattern for DAG construction
- Workflows define phases with pipe, on_fail, retry, goto semantics
- scope run workflows/file.py --target X executes the workflow with parameters
- Workflows compose D1 (piping), D2 (phases), D4 (conditions) into reusable definitions
- Workflows are version-controlled Python files, not config
- Dynamic logic works: conditionals, loops over items, parameterization
