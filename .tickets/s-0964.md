# F3: Loop Termination

Give the orchestrator clear termination criteria so it knows when to stop iterating. Today it either stops too early (first green pass) or too late (infinite refinement). Termination criteria are specified in the contract or skill and checked against feedback signals (F1) after each iteration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Termination criteria can be specified in the contract or skill ('loop completes when all tests pass and lint is clean')
- After each iteration, Scope runs verification (F1) and checks against criteria
- Orchestrator receives explicit recommendation: 'criteria met, recommend terminate' or 'criteria not met, recommend iterate'
- Max iteration bounds prevent infinite loops ('stop after N iterations regardless')
- Orchestrator retains authority to override termination recommendations
