# C2: Poll as Check-in, Wait as Result

Clarify semantics of poll and wait. Poll becomes a lightweight non-blocking check-in: status, elapsed time, tool call count, last activity. Wait becomes the blocking call that returns full result on completion. The orchestrator uses poll to monitor without burning context, wait when ready to consume results.

## Acceptance Criteria

- scope poll <id> returns lightweight non-blocking status: running/done, elapsed time, tool call count, last activity
- scope wait <id> blocks until session completes and returns full result text
- scope poll --all returns compact status summary of all active sessions
- poll output is concise enough to not bloat orchestrator context (one-line per session)
- wait output contains the full result for decision-making
- Clear semantic distinction: poll = 'how's it going?', wait = 'give me the result'
