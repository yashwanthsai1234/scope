# F2: Hierarchical Loop Decomposition

Enable feedback loops to contain other feedback loops. A TDD loop is one level; 'implement auth' decomposes into TDD per module plus integration tests across all. The orchestrator reasons about which level of loop it operates at and decomposes large tasks into nested sub-loops with appropriate feedback signals at each level.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Orchestrator can decompose a large task into nested feedback loops (e.g., TDD per module + integration loop)
- Each sub-loop has its own feedback signals appropriate to its scope (unit tests for module, integration tests for composition)
- Outer loops use inner loop outcomes as feedback signals ('3 of 4 sub-modules pass, 1 needs retry')
- Skills describe decomposition strategies for large features
- Nested loops report results to the outer loop's orchestrator
