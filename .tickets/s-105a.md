# F5: Skill Evolution

Offline improvement loop using GEPA (Genetic-Pareto Algorithm) to iteratively improve skill definitions from session trajectories. Fires automatically after each task completion. An LLM critiques the trajectory against the skill's intent on three axes: pattern adherence, sub-agent instantiation, enforcement quality. Critiques drive mutations to skill prompt text. Candidate updates are staged and versioned.

## Acceptance Criteria

- After each task completes, Scope automatically fires the evolution loop against the session trajectory
- LLM critiques trajectory on three axes: (1) pattern adherence, (2) sub-agent instantiation quality, (3) enforcement quality
- Critique produces candidate skill rewrites with specific improvements
- Updates are staged and accumulated across sessions, versioned for rollback
- Pareto selection across adherence, outcome quality, and sub-agent efficiency
- User can review staged skill diffs before they are applied
